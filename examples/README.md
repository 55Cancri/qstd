# qstd Examples

These are example files that demonstrate the package works correctly. They can be run with `pnpx tsx <file>` for manual verification.

## Files

- `test-all.ts` - Comprehensive test of all shared utilities
- `test-block.tsx` - Test Block component loads

## Usage

```bash
# Test utilities
pnpx tsx examples/test-all.ts

# These serve as smoke tests - if they run without TypeScript errors, the package works!
```
