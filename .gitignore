# TypeScript incremental compilation cache (.tsbuildinfo files)
# These files contain dependency graphs and compilation metadata that enable:
# - Lightning-fast incremental builds (skip unchanged files)
# - Cross-package dependency tracking in monorepos
# - Intelligent recompilation when dependencies change
# 
# IMPORTANT: These files are machine-specific and should NOT be committed
# but should be preserved locally. Deleting them forces full recompilation
# which can be 10-50x slower for the initial build after deletion.
